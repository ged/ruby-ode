== Authors

  * Michael Granger <ged@FaerieMUD.org>


== General Information

This is a Ruby binding for the Open Dynamics Engine, a free, industrial quality
library for simulating articulated rigid body dynamics - for example ground
vehicles, legged creatures, and moving objects in VR environments. It is fast,
flexible, robust and platform independent, with advanced joints, contact with
friction, and built-in collision detection.

You can find out more about ODE, including instructions for obtaining it, on the
author's page at <http://www.q12.org/ode/ode.html>.


== Caveats

*IMPORTANT*: This is an *alpha* release. It might blow up, compromise your
security, write random data to sensitive portions of your hard drive, or
otherwise fail to work as advertised. It is intended to be used by developers
who are interested in helping out or curious onlookers who don't mind getting
a bit wet.

That said, I would greatly appreciate feedback on any aspect of this
software. Suggestions, feature requests, questions, design critiques, and bug
reports are most welcome. Relevant patches are particularly helpful. I may be
reached at <ged@FaerieMUD.org>.
