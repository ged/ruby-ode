  Time-stamp: <04-Feb-2003 04:20:23 deveiant>

== Testing

   * The test suite doesn't contain unit tests for the ODE::Contact class. I
     have to figure out some way to test it without having to set up and tear
     down a full collision system every time.

   * Coverage is only about 75% of the way there for the joint classes.

   * Very little acceptance testing has been done, though the little that has
     been done is promising. The graphical lib will help with that.


== Auxilliary Code

   * The wrapper around the "drawstuff" code isn't done. I have to figure out a
     Ruby-ish idiom for it before proceeding futher.
