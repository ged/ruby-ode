= Ruby-ODE To-do List
  Time-stamp: <04-Feb-2003 15:11:56 deveiant>

== ODE Classes

* The ODE::GeometryTransform and ODE::GeometryTransformGroup have not yet been
  implemented. They will be finished in the next release.


== Testing

* The test suite doesn't contain unit tests for the ODE::Contact class. I have
  to figure out some way to test it without having to set up and tear down a
  full collision system every time.

* Coverage is only about 75% of the way there for the joint classes.

* Very little acceptance testing has been done, though the little that has been
  done is promising. The graphical lib will help with that.


== Auxilliary Code

* The wrapper around the "drawstuff" code isn't done. I have to figure out a
  Ruby-ish idiom for it before proceeding futher.
